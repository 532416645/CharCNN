This repository contains my implementation using TensorFlow for text classification from character-level using convolutional networks. It can be used to reproduce the results in the following article:

Xiang Zhang, Junbo Zhao, Yann LeCun. [Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626). Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015)

## How to use
First, specify the training and testing data sources in the config.py file.

Then, run the training.py file as below:
```sh
$ python training.py
```
